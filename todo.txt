- Create a method that factors in angle
-> this method could still assume only vertical motion.
-> use trig to amplify motion.
-> apply rotation matrix?

- Obtain focal length and distance from lens to calculate displacement in metres
-> Find mm per pixel
-> Use angular size

-Differentiate against light background and dark string vs dark background and light string
-> return topmost value in grad
-> if below a certain threshhold, black background
-> if above a certain threshhold, white background

-> if black background, find max and multiply by -1
-> if white background, find min
