# MotionDetectVideo

MotionDetectVideo is a MATLAB program used to detect an edge, then applying an algorithm to extract displacement signals from a video.

The project was developed in order to obtain data for a University of Calgary Geomatics Engineering research position.

To run, run the setPath.m script first, then run the MotionDetectLine.m script.
